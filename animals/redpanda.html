<h2>Carson, the adorable jerk</h2>

<p>Carson came to the zoo in April of 2016. When he arrived, two other red pandas, a male named Yukiko and a female named Stellar lived here as well. The three did not get along.</p>
<p>Initially, the hope was to take the pair off exhibit, with hope of breeding them, then reintroducing them to the exhibit, but Carson's aggression showed an impediment.The pair remain off-site, with hope for a cub.</p>
<p>Eventually, the decision was made to move the pair to a new zoo, and allow Carson to take over the exhibit.</p>
<p>He can be found in the highest branch of his tree, napping or stomping around the space, marking his territory. It has been reported by his keeper that shaking a tupperware of treats gets his attention, but the millisecond he is not the center of attention, he either loses interest and wanders away, or likes to nip at pant legs.</p>
<p>He's an adorable jerk, and if you can catch a glimpse of him, imagine how soft he is, and try to forgive his aggressive nature.</p>
